  "body": "\r\nThis project comprised of an asynchronous and secure messaging platform. Registered users would be authenticated and given the option to read, write or send messages to other users of the application. The messages themselves were securely encrypted and required passwords to access. User and Message information was stored and accessed through the use of a database.\r\n\r\nThe key aspects of the messaging system were-\r\n\r\n* The Authentication part where the user is prompted to enter a username and password if already registered, or asked to register if not.Once authenticated, the user is given the option to read or send messages.\r\n* A Hash function for the password for each user. We used the SHA256 hash function to implement this. This password was then salted by making use of a randomly generated salt and this was unique for each user. The hashing operation was applied to the password for thousands of iterations thus strengthening the key.\r\n* The Encryption block constituted producing an encrypted message. This encrypted message was the result of an XOR operation between the plain text message and a salsa20 stream ciper generated on the basis of a hashed password agreed on by the two users.\r\n* An SQLite3 database, created for the application with tables for the Users and Messages. The User table stored the username and the unique, randomly generated salt. The Messages table stored the encrypted form of the message.\r\n* The DB handler block was created to connect the code with the database.\r\n\r\nFrom a secure coding perspective rules and recommendations for File Input/Output Handling and Error Handling SEI CERT Coding Standards were taken into account.\r\n\r\nFor the RED team challenge, code review was done keeping in mind all the rules and recommendations. We analyzed the hashing and encryption functions of the opponent based on a number of parameters such as how secure the messages were, whether authentication of users was done properly, whether the db handler could lead to data leaks.\r\n\r\n",
